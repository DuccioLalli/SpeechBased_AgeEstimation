## Description

The goal of this project was to build a regression model for **age estimation from speech**, leveraging both **acoustic** and **linguistic** features extracted from audio recordings.

- The implemented pipeline includes:
- **Feature extraction**, including *Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)*  
- Implementation of two regression models:
  - A **Random Forest Regressor** (main model)  
  - A **Support Vector Machine (SVM) Regressor** (developed for performance comparison)
- **Performance evaluation** against the reference threshold set by the challenge
