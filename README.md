# Age Estimation Through Speech: A Feature-Driven Random Forest Approach

**Project developed for the _Data Science Lab_ course at Politecnico di Torino (Academic Year 2024–2025).**

---

## Description

The goal of this project was to build a regression model for **age estimation from speech**, leveraging both **acoustic** and **linguistic** features extracted from audio recordings.

The implemented pipeline includes:
- **Feature extraction**, including *Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)*  
- A **Random Forest regressor** as the main prediction model  
- **Performance comparison** against an *SVM-based baseline*

The model achieved **good accuracy**, surpassing the reference threshold set by the challenge.
